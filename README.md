# UniteIO
Not a tool, but a rocorf of a baseline design that is allowing me to run free-threading with dozens of packagees that shouldnt really work. 


Mostly for ASGI stackeed apps, but also for some other things, like managing to run the no-gil memory neemesys orjson==3.11.4 (with shiny), and actually feeling pretty comfortable with a full Scieentific Pythin Wheels based envo.
